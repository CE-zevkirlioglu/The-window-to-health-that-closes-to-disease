<h1>The window to health that closes to disease
  
  (Automatic opening window for heart attack and asthma patients)</h1>

<div>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This project, initiated within the framework of the FE401 multidisciplinary integrated project 
course, aims to bring together students from various engineering disciplines to collaboratively 
develop a novel solution. In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, software engineering 
stands out as one of the most popular professions and undergraduate programs, addressing the ever
growing needs of our society. 
  
The project's focal point is based on scientific research findings regarding how temperature and 
humidity affect the health of asthma and heart attack patients. In this context, the project aims to 
develop a smart home window equipped with temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. The window 
will automatically adjust its position and opening/closing based on data from both external and 
internal sensors, striving to provide optimal living conditions for patients. 

This project is also an example of the FE401 multidisciplinary integrated project course offered 
in undergraduate software engineering education. This course provides students with the 
opportunity to collaborate with colleagues from different engineering disciplines and develop skills 
in finding solutions to real-world problems. 

The core problems and needs identified in the project emphasize the significance of controlling 
factors such as air and body temperature, external or home humidity for diseases like asthma and 
heart attacks that persist over the years and cannot be easily prevented. Therefore, the project's goals 
include easing patients' lives, preventing disease attacks, and improving their overall quality of life. 
In addition to mechanical components like Arduino, servo motors, temperature and humidity 
sensors, artificial intelligence tools and resources will be employed in the project. The project not 
only aims to provide a technical solution but also strives to take a concrete step towards a real 
improvement in the lives of asthma and heart attack patients, highlighting the potential impact of 
interdisciplinary collaboration. 

Those evaluating the project will be the project team members, ensuring diverse perspectives to 
capture any potential issues. The actions expected from the readers of this document involve 
reviewing and approving the project's aims, scope, objectives, and technical aspects for general 
acceptance. Additionally, readers are encouraged to provide ideas and feedback for further 
development, participate in monitoring and evaluation processes, and promote the project to a wider 
audience. 

The use of artificial intelligence tools and resources, along with mechanical parts, demonstrates 
the comprehensive approach of the project in addressing the identified problems. The specified 
methods for monitoring progress and evaluation contribute to transparent and effective project 
management, aiming to serve as an example for future similar projects that go beyond providing 
technical solutions, emphasizing the potential positive impact of interdisciplinary collaboration on 
the lives of asthma and heart attack patients.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this technology era which is non-stop and ever-developing, software engineering is one of the 
most popular professions and undergraduate programs, and one of the most needed areas of this age. 
Since software engineering brings with it the words software and engineering, it can be defined as 
the branch of computer science that makes applications, programs, robots, etc. that will make 
people's lives easier -assuming they are not abused- with an engineering approach, using today's and 
old technologies.
  
Multiple courses are offered in software engineering undergraduate education, which allows 
students to make themselves competent in different fields. One of the courses offered is the multi-disciplinary
integrated project course coded FE401. Within the scope of this course, students from 
different engineering departments come together to create a multi-disciplinary concrete project by 
combining their knowledge. Within the scope of this project and our thoughts on some project, to 
create a multi-disciplinary concrete new project that has never done before, we formed a group of 
four people: two software engineering students, one electrical and electronics engineering student 
and one mechanical engineering student.

At the beginning of the FE401 project course, a brainstorm was done by the group on what kind 
of project should be done within the scope of this project. After a while, as a result of our research 
and brainstorm, we found that scientific research revealed that heat and humidity trigger asthma and 
heart attacks. From that point, for asthma and heart attack patients, we decided to make a home 
window that is equipped with heat, humidity, and rain sensors, also, opens automatically by getting 
information from the sensors. We decided to open the window automatically when necessary, based 
on the information received from the temperature, humidity and rain sensors placed outside the 
window and the temperature and humidity sensors placed inside it. If the room temperature is higher 
than a certain temperature, automatically opening the window and reducing the ambient 
temperature if the outside temperature is lower than the room temperature is just an example goal 
of this project.

Last but not least, in the light of the mentioned information, the biggest and primary aim and 
target of this system is to improve the quality of life of asthma patients and heart attack patients, to 
prevent possible attacks and to make their lives easier. The requirements of the automatically 
opening window project for heart attack and asthma patients will be revealed within the scope of 
this process and a concrete and functional model of the system will be created.

<h2>Needs/Problems</h2>
<p>
Asthma and heart attack diseases that persist for years and cannot be easily prevented are very 
important diseases that need to be under control in terms of some factors such as air and body 
temperature, humidity of outside or home, etc. Some factors like these, and perhaps many 
undiscovered factors, make the lives of these patients difficult. There are many studies and articles 
that reveal these difficulties. Unfortunately, there is no system today that is customized to these 
patients and can cure their diseases. Instead of creating systems for them, only activities such as 
training and conferences were satisfied.
  
Considering this information and the scientific research, the following problems and needs arise:
<h4>Problems:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
      The rise in temperature and humidity triggers heart attacks and asthma attacks. 
  </li>
  <li>
      For every 5 degrees that the air temperature increases, the risk of heart attack increases by 5 percent.  
  </li>
  <li>
      The ideal humidity range for asthma patients is 30% to 50%. It is even stated that one should not leave the house if the level exceeds 60%. 
  </li>
  <li>
      Blood circulation in the skin, which tries to keep the body's temperature constant in hot weather, puts a strain on the heart. Blood fluidity decreases due to fluid, salt and electrolyte loss due to sweating, which forces the heart to exert more effort once again. It can cause high blood pressure, arrhythmia and heart attack in those with heart problems. 
  </li>
  <li>
      It should not be overlooked that situations where temperature and humidity combine are more critical.
  </li>
  <li>
      Asthma and heart attack attacks not only affect patients who take an active role in society, but also affect their environment and colleagues in terms of both psychological and work disruption.
  </li>
  
</ul>
